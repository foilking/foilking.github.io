                    <p>
                        One year ago today, I started my first long term remote working time. 
                        Previously, I had often worked remotely once or twice a week, often biking to a local coffee shop or the library to work.
                        But on that Friday the 13th, I found myself in a different situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Thursday before, I found that my son was sick with Influenza-B, so I had planned on working remote that Friday anyways. 
                        With all the talk about the Cornavirus making it to Wisconsin, my co-workers and I were making predictions of when the office would have people work remotely.
                        So as I left that Thursday, I made sure to have everything I'd need to work remotely for a couple days of staying at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all the bedrooms taken, I had to carve out a little space in my unfinished basement in order to have a defined workspace.
                        I had an old table, a dining room chair, and a second monitor to start off the remote life. Sadly, all the beer in the picture was expired.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That Friday, the email went out that contractors were to work remotely. 
                        I was glad that I had grabbed what I needed, as I wasn't sure I'd be able to come back to the office anytime soon.
                        First thing I needed to do was to get an office chair in. Finding a full mesh one was a little bit difficult and I had to travel a bit outside my neighborhood to find one.
                        In addition, I picked up a bike trainer to make sure I got some exercise during my remote working time.
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MwiDNsY.jpg" width="100%" alt="New Chair" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a bit, I decided to make some more space for myself and moved out a bunch of shelves into the rest of the basement.
                        I put down some leftover carpet to make the space feel warmer. Getting a poster up and some of my kids work made it feel more like home.
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/alUkKOQ.jpg" width="100%" alt="Cleared out space" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In July, my company offered me a full time position, which I gladly accepted. 
                        When I stopped by the office to sign paperwork, I grabbed the pair of monitors and laptop dock from my desk.
                        Two monitors is great, but three is optimal!
                        Additionally, I brought out a small, old bookcase, a file cabinet, and a printer to round out the office. Every office needs a printer.
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GcofPTu.jpg" width="100%" alt="Looking like an office with a printer" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the space opened up, I decided to add some bookshelves. 
                        This allowed me to make it feel more like a study, rather than a hole in the wall.
                        I'm still working on making it better, but at least now it feels like a place I can work in even after the pandemic.
